# Tivra DebugMind - Demo Recording Flow

## Pre-Demo Setup

### 1. Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/sansy/Documents/Tivra-AI/tivra-copilot/server
node index.js
```
**Status:** Server should be running on `http://localhost:3001` with **USE_MOCK_DATA=true**

### 2. VSCode Extension Settings
Add to your VSCode `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "tivra.apiUrl": "http://localhost:3001"
}
```

### 3. Open a Workspace
- Open any folder in VSCode (this will be where the fix is applied)
- The demo will create `src/lambda/payment-processor/index.js` with the fix

---

### **Step 5: Code Fix Generated (After 1 Second)**

**What You'll See:**
```
‚ú® Code Fix Generated!

Fix: Add retry logic with exponential backoff

Impact: Reduce error rate from 12.5% to <1%

```javascript
// Add retry logic with exponential backoff for DynamoDB operations

async function processPaymentWithRetry(paymentData, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      // Process payment with DynamoDB conditional check
      const result = await dynamoDb.putItem({
        TableName: 'payments',
        Item: paymentData,
        ConditionExpression: 'attribute_not_exists(paymentId) OR version = :currentVersion',
        ExpressionAttributeValues: {
          ':currentVersion': paymentData.version
        }
      });

      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.name === 'ConditionalCheckFailedException' && attempt < maxRetries - 1) {
        // Exponential backoff: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms
        const delayMs = 100 * Math.pow(2, attempt);
        console.log(`Retry attempt ${attempt + 1} after ${delayMs}ms`);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs));
        continue;
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

File: `src/lambda/payment-processor/index.js`

```

---

### **Step 6: Apply the Fix**
- Click or type: **"Apply Fix"**

**What You'll See:**
```
üîÑ Applying fix to src/lambda/payment-processor/index.js...
```

Then:
```
‚úÖ Fix Applied Successfully!

File: src/lambda/payment-processor/index.js
```

**File Opens in Editor:**
- The file `src/lambda/payment-processor/index.js` is created
- Contains the retry logic code
- Opens automatically in the left pane

---

### **Step 7: Deployment Success (After 2 Seconds)**

**What You'll See:**
```
üéâ Deployment Successful!

Error Status: ‚úÖ All Clear

The fix has been deployed and errors have been resolved!

Before Fix:
‚Ä¢ Error Rate: 12.5%
‚Ä¢ Total Errors: 145/hour
‚Ä¢ Failed Requests: ConditionalCheckFailedException (89)

After Fix:
‚Ä¢ Error Rate: 0.2%
‚Ä¢ Total Errors: 3/hour
‚Ä¢ Status: Normal operations

Impact:
‚úÖ 97% reduction in errors
‚úÖ Payment processing restored
‚úÖ Customer transactions flowing normally

Your production services are healthy! üöÄ

## Demo Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 0:00 | Open DebugMind copilot |
| 0:05 | Click "Connect me to AWS" |
| 0:10 | Enter Access Key |
| 0:12 | Enter Secret Key |
| 0:14 | Enter Region (us-east-1) |
| 0:16 | AWS Connected ‚Üí Services discovered |
| **0:18** | **Auto error detection starts** |
| **0:19** | **Error analysis shown** |
| **0:20** | **Code fix generated** |
| 0:22 | User clicks "Apply Fix" |
| 0:24 | File created and opened |
| **0:26** | **Success message: Errors gone!** |

**Total Demo Duration:** ~30 seconds (after AWS connection)

---

## Key Demo Highlights

1. **Zero Manual Work:** Errors are detected automatically 2 seconds after connection
2. **Instant Root Cause:** AI analyzes 145 errors and identifies the root cause
3. **Ready-to-Use Fix:** Code is generated with proper retry logic and exponential backoff
4. **One-Click Application:** "Apply Fix" button creates the file in your workspace
5. **Success Confirmation:** Shows before/after metrics proving the fix worked

---

## Recording Tips

### Camera Angles
1. **Full Screen VSCode:** Show entire interface
2. **Zoom in on Chat:** When showing error analysis and fix
3. **Split View:** Left = code editor, Right = copilot chat

### Narration Points
- "Watch how it automatically detects errors after connecting"
- "Notice the detailed root cause analysis with 89 occurrences"
- "The AI generates production-ready code with exponential backoff"
- "One click to apply the fix directly in my workspace"
- "And instantly shows the impact: 97% error reduction"

### What Makes This Demo Powerful
- **Speed:** 30 seconds from connection to fix deployed
- **Intelligence:** Analyzes 145 errors, finds the real root cause
- **Actionability:** Generates actual code, not just suggestions
- **Impact:** Shows measurable results (12.5% ‚Üí 0.2% error rate)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If server doesn't connect:
```bash
# Check server is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Should return: {"ok":true}
```

### If errors don't auto-show:
- Check console logs in VSCode Developer Tools
- Verify `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` in `.env`
- Restart the backend server

### If "Apply Fix" fails:
- Make sure you have a workspace folder open
- VSCode needs write permissions to create files

---

## Post-Demo Cleanup

To switch back to production mode:
1. Update VSCode settings: `"tivra.apiUrl": "https://copilot.tivra.ai"`
2. Update server `.env`: `USE_MOCK_DATA=false`
3. Delete the demo fix file if created

---

## Mock Data Details

The demo uses enhanced mock data:
- **Service:** payment-processor Lambda function
- **Error:** ConditionalCheckFailedException from DynamoDB
- **Volume:** 145 errors in 1 hour (12.5% error rate)
- **Root Cause:** Optimistic locking conflicts
- **Fix:** Retry logic with exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms)
- **Impact:** 97% error reduction

This scenario is realistic and commonly seen in production systems!
